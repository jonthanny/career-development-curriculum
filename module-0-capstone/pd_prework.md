# Turing Career Development - Mod 0 Capstone
## Developing Mindsets to Succeed
_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

When you're transitioning careers, often many other aspects of your approach to work and life undergo a transition as well. Turing aims to be a place where you can work through these transitions successfully. While enrolled at Turing and during your subsequent job search, you'll be provided with tools and strategies to develop the professional skills necessary to enter a new career as a software developer. 

The pre-work for career development is focused on introducing you to a set of mindsets that we at Turing believe will make you a successful programmer. These mindsets are:

* Agency: Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* Empathy: Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them 
* Engagement: Active participation in community
* Grit: A combination of perseverance and passion
* Growth: A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

Your Gear Up pre-work is focused on Empathy, so that is not a focus of this pre-work while the other four mindsets will be introduced to you here. Your objectives in this pre-work are to:

* Understand the non-coding aspects that go into being a successful programmer
* Reflect on your current mindsets and build an understanding of new or differing mindsets 
* Understand a strengths-based approach to development
* Begin analyzing how your strengths apply to your development at Turing

### Introduction to Strengths-based Development
One tool we'll be using for your professional development at Turing is the [Pairin Survey](https://www.pairin.com/). This survey measures over 100 coachable and changeable skills. This activity invites you to begin building an understanding of how learning about and developing your strengths applies to your success in your new career. We will discuss the results of this survey more in-depth in your first professional development session at Turing. Follow the steps below to fulfill this part of the prework:

Step 1: Take the survey using [this link](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/15960/student). It will prompt you to create an account when you take it. There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. 

  The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes. 

Step 2: Read this post and watch this video to start building an understanding of your Pairin results (5 minutes total):

   * [Pairin Qualities Overview](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Pairin%20Top%20Qualities%20Overview.pdf) (2.5 minute read)
      
Step 3: Please respond to the following questions in a reflection (4-6 sentences):
   * What is your greatest strength and how do you know? 
   
My greatest strength is my ability to make complex and surprising connections in a variety of ways. I already use this in my creative life to pair seemingly disparate ideas into one harmonious visual. This skill spills over into other areas, and can be accessed by the logical side of my brain. I know this based past experience, learning what it takes to be a creative, and others' feedback.


   * How do you work best?
    I work best by diving into a problem individually. I first need to sort out all the pieces and build a framework of the issue in my mind. Once that's been established, I let my mind explore the framework by jumping around to different elements and seeing what can be combined or sorted in some way. I then move on to testing each idea out until my intuition gives me the nudge that something has 'clicked.'
   * What is your greatest area of improvement?
    * My greatest area of opportunity is expanding my learning process to include the perspectives of others. I often isolate when focused on completing a task. This closes off the possibility of having an outside perspective there to compare ideas and offer new solutions. I sometimes have a fear of asking for help based on the feeling that I need to do everything on my own, and that's a habit I hope to break at Turing.
   * How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?
    * To my understanding, coding is just complex problem solving. I hope to use my creative brain to see new ways to engineer code and arrive at surprising solutions. I want to double down on my ability to process information and spin it in new ways in my head in order to drive innovation. I hope to even apply this to my learning process and come up with engaging study tactics that will maximize comprehension.
   * How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer? 
    * By know my strengths and working preferences, I can more seamlessly integrate into a team. It's crucial to know what you can contribute so that you can spend more time doing the things you're good at, instead of fighting your natural abilities. Knowing where you can fit it, where you can offer help, and where you can broaden your horizons allows the individual and the team to thrive in the most efficient way. Furthermore I can decide what area of software development I will be most successful in. This is a broad field and I wish to find my niche so I can be a valuable asset to a team.

   
 Step 4: Read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, ["Getting Better at Difficult Things"](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/a-quick-note-on-getting-better-at-difficult-things/387133/) and watch Kathy Sierra's keynote from [Fluent Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM)
 
 Step 5: Please respond to the following questions in a reflection (4-6 sentences):
  * What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?
  * How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
  * What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?
  * How will you prepare yourself to be at your best with your learning process while at Turing?
